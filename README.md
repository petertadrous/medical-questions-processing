An NLP Analysis of Medical Questions for CUS635 - Web Data Mining

## About

This was a project for my CUS635 - Web Data Mining course in which we were tasked with finding or scraping a dataset of medical questions from online, and performing some natural language processing analysis on these questions to gain some meaningful insights.

## Project Tasks

#### Data Understanding & Acquisition

1. Identify a source of social media data containing medical questions. You can use any source using (a) downloadable datasets (e.g. Kaggle), (b) programming API (e.g. Twitter), or (c) Web Scraping (e.g. Python Beautiful Soap). To qualify the data must contain medical questions (e.g. “Can aspirin be used on patients with kidney impairment?”) from patients or HCPs.

#### Data Cleaning

2. Perform any data cleaning you deem necessary (e.g. stop-wording, tokenization, etc.). Provide an example of raw data along with its cleaned version.

#### NERs

3. Identify useful tokens (single or multi-words) using any of the techniques learned in this class or from other sources and report your findings.

### Topic Modeling

4. Perform a topic analysis by applying any of the models learned in class:
   a. Try your best to identify the optimal number of topics k contained in your dataset.
   b. Provide a descriptive label for each topic; e.g. "Side Effects" or "Pneumonia".
   c. Report your results
